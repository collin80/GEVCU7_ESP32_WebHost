An ESP32 program that runs on the on-board ESP32 on a GEVCU7 board. 

Provides a web interface (not actually done yet) as well as telnet style access to the GEVCU7 serial console. 

Utilizes mDNS to allow for a nice host name (gevcu7.local by default). 

Meant to be compiled with ESP32-Arduino 3.0 or higher
